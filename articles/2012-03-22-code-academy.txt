Well, it's official: In April, I'm leaving my job as a trial lawyer to work full-time on developing web applications with the Spring 2012 development class at [Code Academy](http://codeacademy.org).

[Code Academy](http://codeacademy.org) is an 11 week course that teaches the basics of web development using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

I've been teaching myself Rails for the past year or so. I've made a lot of progress, but I've found it difficult to get the the next level without any real support. I think Code Academy [Code Academy](http://codeacademy.org) is the perfect opportunity for me to continue learning, build my ideas, and get to know all of the awesome people in the Chicago development community. I can't wait to get started!
